The AMS13 is one of the most important conferences that brings our members together from around the world to share the latest advances in membrane science and technology and provides a great opportunity to expand our professional networks. 

The Aseanian Membrane Society (AMS) was founded in 2002 to advance and benefit membrane science and technology in the regions of “Asian” and “Oceanian”. AMS endeavors to serve membranologists in these regions and to promote and connect with membrane organizations around the world. AMS organizes an annual AMS Conference, except for the years when the International Congress on Membranes & Membrane Processes (ICOM) is held, which takes place every three years. The most recent AMS Conference (AMS12) took place in in Jeju, Korea in 2019 and attracted hundreds of participants from the member societies and across many other related fields. 

AMS13 has been successfully completed on 6 July 2022.
