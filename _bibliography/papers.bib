  abstract = {Nanofluidic diodes are potentially useful in many important applications such as sensing, electronics, and energy conversion. However, the manufacturing of controllable nanopores for nanofluidic diodes is technically challenging. Herein, a nanofluidic diode is designed from a highly programmatic covalent organic framework (COF). Through molecular simulation, remarkable diode behavior is observed in a hybrid-bilayer COF but not in its constituent single-layer COFs. The rectification effect of ion current in the hybrid-bilayer COF is attributed to an asymmetric electrostatic potential across the COF nanopore. Furthermore, a synergistic effect of counterion is unraveled in the hybrid-bilayer COF, and the presence of counterion is found to reduce the entry barrier and facilitate ion transport. The performance of the hybrid-bilayer COF as a nanofluidic diode is comprehensively investigated by varying salt concentration, layer number, interlayer spacing, and slipping. This proof-of-concept simulation study demonstrates the feasibility of the hybrid-bilayer COF as a nanofluidic diode and the finding may stimulate the development of new nanofluidic platforms.},

  abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) membranes have received considerable interest for separation. The channels in GO membranes are in an atomic scale and thus it is challenging to unravel underlying separation mechanism via experiment. In this study, we model multilayered GO membranes with various channel widths (W) and oxidation degrees (O/C), subsequently simulate their performance for bioethanol (an ethanol/water mixture) purification. In the sub-nm membranes with W = 0.75 nm, ethanol-selective permeation occurs at a low O/C but it changes to highly water-selective at a high O/C (with separation factor αH2O/EtOH of 5 and ∞ at O/C = 15% and 35%, respectively). In the wider membranes with W = 1.00 and 1.50 nm, moderate ethanol-selective permeation with αEtOH/H2O of 1–3 is observed. Detailed microscopic analysis reveals that ethanol and water differ in their intercalation and diffusion. In the wider membranes, both ethanol and water exhibit similar intercalation behavior and adopt Fickian diffusion, particularly at a low O/C ratio. In the sub-nm channels, both components feature sub-diffusion but ethanol has negligible diffusion at a high O/C = 35%. Depending on W, ordered structures with different layers are formed for ethanol and water. In the sub-nm channels, hydrogen bonds between water and channel are found to increase in number with increasing O/C ratio but their stability decreases. The microscopic insight provides quantitative understanding of bioethanol purification in GO membranes, and might facilitate the development of new GO membranes for important separation processes.},

  abstract = {Recently there has been considerable interest in the utilization of covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) as ionexchange membranes. While rapid ion conduction is experimentally observed in COF membranes, the under­ lying mechanism remains elusive. Herein, we report a molecular simulation study on chloride ion (Cl− ) con­ duction in four COF membranes functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups (QA-2, QA-4, QA-6 and QAEO) of different side chains (ethyl, butyl, hexyl and diethyl ether). It is revealed that membrane flexibility is crucial to be incorporated in simulation for reliable predictions. The Cl− conductivities in the four membranes are predicted to decrease as COF-QA-2 > COF-QA-4 ≈ COF-QA-EO > COF-QA-6, which is in good agreement with experimental data. The pore size, rather than membrane-Cl− interaction, is unravelled to be the key factor governing the trend of conductivity. The microscopic insight provided by simulation is useful to elucidate the fundamental mechanism of ion conduction, and might facilitate the design of new COF membranes for optimal ion conduction.},

However, the design of new high-FFV polymers is challenging. In this study, we report a data-driven approach and aim to accelerate the discovery of high-FFV polymers. First, a computational method is proposed to calculate FFV, and a two-step fragmentation method is developed to construct a fragment library for digital representation of polymer structures. Data mining is employed to identify promising fragments for high FFV. Subsequently, machine learning (ML) models are trained using a data set with 1683 polymers and their excellent transferability is demonstrated by out-of-sample predictions in another data set with 11,479 polymers. Finally, the ML models are used to screen ∼1 million hypothetical polymers, and 29,482 polymers with FFV > 0.2 are shortlisted; representative high-FFV polymers are validated by molecular simulations, and design strategies are highlighted. To further facilitate the discovery of new high-FFV polymers, we develop an online interactive platform https://ffv-prediction.herokuapp.com, which allows for rapid FFV predictions, given polymer structures. The data-driven approach in this study might advance the development of new high-FFV polymers and further explore quantitative structure–property relationships for polymers.},

  abstract = {Pervaporation ({PV}) is considered as a robust membrane-based separation technology for liquid mixtures. However, the development of {PV} membranes is impeded largely by the lack of adequate models capable of reliably predicting the performance of {PV} membranes. In this study, we collect an experimental data set with a total of 681 data samples including 16 polymers and 6 organic solvents for a wide variety of water/organic mixtures under various operating conditions. Then, two types of machine learning ({ML}) models are developed for prediction and high-throughput screening of polymer membranes for {PV} separation. Based on the intrinsic properties of polymer and solvent (water contact angle of polymer and solubility parameter of solvent) as gross descriptors, the first type accurately predicts {PV} separation performance (total flux and separation factor). The second type is based on the molecular representation of polymer and solvent, giving accuracy comparable to the first type, and applied to screen ∼1 million hypothetical polymers for {PV} separation of water/ethanol mixtures. With a threshold of 700 for the {PV} separation index, 20 polymers are shortlisted, with many surpassing experimental samples. Among these, 10 are further identified to be synthesizable in terms of a synthetic complexity score. The {ML} models developed in this study would facilitate the optimization of operating conditions and accelerate the development of new polymer membranes for high-performance {PV} separation.},

  abstract = {Fouling is a major obstacle and challenge in membrane-based separation processes. Caused by the sophisticated interactions between foulant and membrane surface, fouling strongly depends on membrane surface chemistry and roughness. Current studies in the field have been largely focused on polymer membranes. Herein, a molecular dynamics simulation study is reported for fouling on alumina and graphene membrane surfaces during water treatment. For two foulants (sucralose and bisphenol A), it is found that the fouling on alumina surfaces is reduced with increasing surface roughness; however, the fouling on graphene surfaces is enhanced by roughness. It is unravelled that the foulant–surface interaction becomes weaker in the ridge region of a rough alumina surface, thus allowing foulant to leave the surface and reducing fouling. Nevertheless, such behavior is not observed on a rough graphene surface because of strong foulant–graphene interaction. In addition, with increasing roughness, the hydrogen bonds between water and alumina surface are found to increase in number as well as stability. This simulation study reveals that surface chemistry and roughness play a crucial role in membrane fouling, and the microscopic insights are useful for the design of new membranes toward high-performance water treatment.},

  abstract = {At present, 100 000+ metal–organic frameworks ({MOFs}) have been synthesized, and it is challenging to identity the best candidate for a specific application. In this study, {MOFs} are rapidly screened via a hierarchical approach for propane/propylene (C3H8/C3H6) separation. First, the adsorption capacity and selectivity of C3H8/C3H6 mixture in “Computation-Ready, Experimental” ({CoRE}) {MOFs} are predicted via a molecular simulation ({MS}) method. The relationships between separation metrics and structural factors are established, and top-performing {CoRE} {MOFs} are identified. Then, machine learning ({ML}) models are trained and developed upon the {CoRE} {MOFs} using pore size, pore geometry, and framework chemistry as feature descriptors. By introducing binned pore size distributions and geometric descriptors, the accuracy of {ML} models is substantially improved. The feature importance of the descriptors is physically interpreted by the Gini impurities and Shapley Additive Explanations. Subsequently, the {ML} models are used to rapidly screen experimental “Cambridge Structural Database” ({CSD}) {MOFs} and hypothetical {MOFs} for C3H8/C3H6 separation. In the {CSD} {MOFs}, the out-of-sample predictions are found to agree well with simulation results, demonstrating the excellent transferability of the {ML} models from the {CoRE} to {CSD} {MOFs}. Moreover, nine {CSD} {MOFs} are identified to possess separation performance superior to top-performing {CoRE} {MOFs}. Finally, the similarity and diversity among experimental and hypothetical {MOFs} are visualized and compared by the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-{SNE}) feature projections. Remarkably, the {CoRE} and {CSD} {MOFs} are revealed to share a close similarity in both chemical and geometric feature spaces. By synergizing {MS} and {ML}, the hierarchical approach developed in this study would advance the rapid screening of {MOFs} across different databases toward industrially important separation processes.},

  abstract = {Emerging as a distinct type of molecular cage possessing both intrinsic and extrinsic porosity, porous organic cages ({POCs}) have been regarded as intriguing nanofillers to produce molecularly mixed composite membranes ({MMCMs}). Here, we report a molecular simulation study to examine the swelling of three {MMCMs} in water, methanol, and acetonitrile and then explore their applications for water desalination and solvent recovery. The {MMCMs} are formed by mixing three {POCs} ({CC}1, {CC}3, and {CC}17, respectively) with a polymer of intrinsic microporosity ({PIM}-1). The {POC}/{PIM} membranes exhibit the greatest swelling in methanol, followed by acetonitrile and water. It is revealed that the periphery groups on the {POCs} have different interactions with the polymer and solvent during swelling, which plays a significant role in determining the structures of swollen membranes. Remarkably, water and methanol permeabilities through {PIM}-1 are enhanced 1–2-fold by all three {POCs}, while acetonitrile permeability is enhanced 1-fold by {CC}17. The enhancement is primarily attributed to the large voids formed in swollen membranes during swelling. Within the simulation durations in this study, all three {POC}/{PIM} membranes exhibit perfect rejection toward salt ({NaCl}) and a small solute (paracetamol). Furthermore, the {POCs} are observed to provide an additional pathway for solvent transport. A majority of water molecules can reside within the {POCs} for less than 400 ps, while methanol and acetonitrile molecules reside for approximately 1000 and 2000 ps. The residence time of the solvent is unravelled to depend on not only the solvent–cage interaction but also the solvent size and shape. From the bottom up, this comprehensive simulation study provides microscopic insights into the crucial effects of the {POCs} on the swelling and solvent permeation of {POC}/{PIM} membranes, and it facilitates the judicious selection of appropriate {POCs} to produce high-performance {MMCMs} for water desalination, solvent recovery, and other industrially important molecular separation.},

By mixing artificial seawater and river water, an unprecedented high output power density of 10.6 W m−2 is obtained, outperforming all existing materials. Molecular dynamics ({MD}) simulations reveal the mechanism of the ultrafast transport in V-{GO} results from the quick entering of ions and the large accessible area as well as the apparent short diffusion paths in V-{GO}. These results will facilitate the practical application of osmotic energy and bring an innovative design strategy for various systems involving ultrafast transport, such as filtration and catalysis.},

  abstract = {Ion-selective nanotubes have great potential in applications such as ion separation, desalination, and power generation. However, their performance is often limited by the deteriorated selectivity in mixed salt solutions. To reveal the underlying mechanism of the mixture effect on ion transport through nanotubes, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on ion transport through carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polymer nanopores with a pore diameter of ∼1 nm and a charge density of −1 e nm−2. Based on the simulation results, when a single salt solution is replaced by a mixed salt solution, the ionic selectivity drops as the permeability of higher permeable ions decreases much greater than that of lower permeable ions. This is because the adsorption of lower permeable ions on the inner surface of nanotubes blocks the ion flux and increases the entrance barrier to the nanotube, and the adsorption is significantly reduced in the mixed salt solution. Such a reduction results from the occupancy of higher permeable ions on the adsorption sites as they have a higher adsorption tendency albeit weaker adsorption compared with lower permeable ions. These studies will help design the next generation of nanostructures to circumvent the mixture effect and show high permeability and selectivity in real applications.},

Our results indicate that the dehydration effect governs the ionic transport at low surface charge densities, hence the nanochannel shows a selectivity for Li+ ions. In contrast, the nanochannel switches to a selectivity for Mg2+ ions as the electrostatic interaction between the cations and the negatively charged wall dominates the transport at high surface charge densities.},
