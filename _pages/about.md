I am currently working as a research fellow at the department of chemical & biomolecular engineering college of design and engineering, National University of Singapore (NUS). I received my bachelor's degree from the college of physics, Sichuan University (SCU) in 2014. In 2015, I started my PhD in the study of molecular modeling of ionic selective nanochannels in the group of [Prof. Yugang Wang](http://faculty.pku.edu.cn/wangyugang/zh_CN/jsxx/11593/jsxx/jsxx.htm) in Peking University (PKU). After obtaining my PhD by the end of 2019, I joined the group of [Prof. Jianwen Jiang](https://cheed.nus.edu.sg/stf/chejj/) in NUS as a postdoctoral researcher.

My research focuses on machine learning and molecular modeling assisted material discovery and design for energy and environmental applications. The research is in the multidisciplinary field of materials, chemistry, physics and engineering. I am passionate about the development of computational tools/machine learning models which can be used to accelerate the process of materials discovery and design for energy and environmental applications, such as water desalination, gas separation, organic solvent nanofiltration.
