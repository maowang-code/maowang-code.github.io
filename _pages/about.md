I am presently an Associate Researcher at the College of Polymer Science and Engineering, Sichuan University (SCU). I earned my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University in 2014 and completed my Ph.D. in the group of [Prof. Yugang Wang](http://faculty.pku.edu.cn/wangyugang/zh_CN/jsxx/11593/jsxx/jsxx.htm) at Peking University in 2019. From 2020 to 2023, I served as a Research Fellow in the group of [Prof. Jianwen Jiang](https://cheed.nus.edu.sg/stf/chejj/) at the National University of Singapore. 

Mg research is dedicated to the synergy of machine learning and molecular modeling in advancing material discovery and design, with a primary emphasis on applications in the fields of energy and environmental sustainability such as membrane-based separations, water splitting, fuel cells, nanomedicines.
